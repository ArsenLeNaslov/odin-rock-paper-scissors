# Odin Rock Paper Scissors
Odin Project's JavaScript exercise game "Rock Paper Scissors"

A digital space-themed version of this classic chinese game.

The first version of the game was a basic one. The instructions were written on screen, while the actual game was played through a floating prompt, and results printed on the Developer Console.

The Game was then updated with space-themed UI elements, EventListeners, and DOM manipulation, allowing the player to run the game by interacting with visual element on screen.
