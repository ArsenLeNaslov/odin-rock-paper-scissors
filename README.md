# odin-rock-paper-scissors
Odin Project's JavaScript exercise game "Rock Paper Scissors"

The first version of the game was a basic one. The instructions were written on screen, while the actual game was played through a floating prompt, and results printed on the Developer Console.

The Game was then updated with UI elements, EventListeners, and DOM manipulation, allowing the player to run the game by interacting with visual element on screen.
